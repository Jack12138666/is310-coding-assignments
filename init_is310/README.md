4. AI Tool/Workflow 

How will you work with AI? What tools if any do you plan to use?

I plan to use AI primarily to assist in coding and learning. For example, I can ask AI to help me understand programming concepts, generate example code, or debug issues. I also plan to use ChatGPT specifically to check spelling and grammar in my written work, ensuring that my explanations and documentation are clear and accurate. Maybe I will use github copilot only if i needed them to learn and not for doing my whole assignment.
